  <title>Just new photo</title>
  <description>Ye I know it can be provocative, but first it is personal blog and second: maybe we must go deep and speak about experiments(or business?) in the "child" place? Just interpretation of snow, what you see? I see a powder with radio, i mean a same powder doctors pushed to my mounth when i tryed to protest to radio observation/control. Maybe you see the freedom? Or happy childs playing on the ground:) Or they are not kids, they are omens? Just continue to interpret :D And analyze the mirror, analyzing behaviour. Last words was for my doctor. Heh, ye I am continuing my personal drama, last photos really about it.  What will be next? Wanna something nice... **about kids, how i understand here +19000 new kids, ye? crazy, sure they will love this... but not about politics: i love radio and think biotechnology can be usefull, but here not any radioclub and war with biolabs research in nearest country(i can not name it it think), i mean it is really 1984 - double thinking, how to understand it? or we as a country wan't make research but buying technology and use it on kids while making oil? they must not understand...they must not to make it ownself and even write about it? i just cannot understand, which church can support it? heh ah yes, no questions. lets look the k1r1lL(just imagine nickname) on tv</description>
